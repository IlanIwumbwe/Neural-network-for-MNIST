# Neural-network-for-MNIST
The "Hello World" of machine learning. I used the book "MAKE YOUR OWN NEURAL NETWORK", written by Tariq Rashid. A beginner friendly text that goes through an implementation of a neural network without machine learning libraries to recognise hand-written digits. This is an older project I worked on between December 2020 and January 2021
